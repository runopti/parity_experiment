seq_len 15

seq_len 15 didn't really learn because the update only happens after seeing 15 digits. 
So now I'm testing it with total.

The above total didn't really work when #hidden units is small. So I'm doing it with #hiddenunits=4 to 8. 
I also decreased lr by 10 after around 180epoch.

First test with lstm because I think the reason why it's not learning is the gradient vanishing/exploding
