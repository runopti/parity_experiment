Did 12 experiments. Will see the results tomorrow morning.
- GREAT. The ones with "total" instead of "single" seem working very well.
- (from Sigmoid-2016-07-14-23:00:19 and thereafter)
- The loss actually got down to 0. 
- But I should check if the acc_list thing is working or not.

Getting the good model to check if acc_list makes sense.
- The log-diff got trapped at the beginning and halted the experiment.

Added the value-clipping to the cross-entropy loss but not working.
- The loss plot looks good (no inf anymore) but acc_list looks still wried.
- So I need to check this.

Used uniform sampling data generation.
