To do: 

2016-06-17
- write a script for option parsing
- experiment with a gpu 
- understand the tutorial code

- incorporate those files in test with the class files and main.py
- note that there are lots of other scripts that I wrote in ptb folder. (/Users/yutaro/tensorflow/tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb)

rnn_test_classif.py is the one that will produce correct results.
